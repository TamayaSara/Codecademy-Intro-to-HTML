# Codecademy-Intro-to-HTML
<h1>Here a list of what I have learned:</h1>
<ul>
<li> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.</li>
<li>Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.</li>
<li>HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.</li>
<li>Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing body tags.</li>
<li>Headings and sub-headings, h1 to h6 tags, are used to provide titles for sections of content.
p, span and div tags specify text or blocks.</li>
<li>Line breaks are created with the br tag.</li>
<li>Ordered lists ol are numbered and unordered lists ul are bulleted.</li>
<li>Images img and videos video can be added by linking to an existing source.</li>
</ul>
